Not the typical representation of King Arthur, who is typically a father figure or man commanding high respect to his knights. The king has sex with his wife, and then sleeps.\\

*THEME*: A noble woman should be able to tell a story; *self-reflexive text*.\\

By line 5920, he is back to being the wise, just King Arthur.\\

Kay's story:

- Seven years ago, he was a /lonely/ peasant. Strange to describe a peasant as lonely, but what he meant was that he did not have the company of the other knights of the round table.
- He was equipped as a knight, looking for work. Comes to a path in a deserted forest, and follows the road despite their being many obstacles along the way. Only the best and the bravest can get through.
- He sees a tower a short way ahead of him.
- Before the tower, there is a moat. He sees a man with a hunting hawk outside the tower, and is offered shelter by the owner of the castle.
  - Lots of discussion of birds in the tales; falcons, hunting birds. The lords practice falconry as a way of conveying their power and wealth. Part of the decor of the book, as part of the culture of the tale.
- After the man invites Kay in, he sees a beautiful woman. She helps him out of his armor, and gives him a cloak. /imagery: clothing/ (/p.9, ln.230/).
- In return for his hospitality, the owner of the castle asks him to return, presumably because he wants to marry off his daughter to Kay.
